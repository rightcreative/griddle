# rcssgrid
<h3>CSS Grid Framework</h3>

<h5>Usage:</h5>

<p>To use RCSSGrid, you start with a wrapper or parent element with the "grid" class added, as well as a class specifying how many columns you want your grid to have. Available options include <strong>grid8</strong>, <strong>grid12</strong>, <strong>grid14</strong>, or <strong>grid16</strong>.</p>

<p>The default gap between columns and rows is 0. To adjust the gaps between columns and rows, you can use cg and rg classes, up to 50px, in increments of 10px. For example, if you wanted a 10px gap, you would use <strong>cg10</strong> and <strong>rg10</strong>.


&lt;div class="grid grid12 cg10 rg10"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
